<!-- ## About Me -->

Welcome to my page! 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

My name is Yebowen Hu. I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/), coadviced by [Prof. Fei Liu](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~fliu40/) and [Prof. Hassan Foroosh](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~foroosh/). 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

My research interests are mainly focus on Summarization and Large Language Models. It is exciting to explore future directions of summarization tech and task in the era of LLMs.

Before I join UCF, I received my M.S. degree from University of Florida, major in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I received my B.S. degree from Central South University, **Changsha China*, major in Electrical Automation.
