<!-- ## About Me -->

Welcome to my page! My name is Yebowen Hu. I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/) at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/). It's an honor to be co-adviced by [Prof. Fei Liu](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~fliu40/) from Emory University and [Prof. Hassan Foroosh](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~foroosh/) from UCF.

My research interests are mainly focus on Summarization and Large Language Models. It is interesting to explore future directions of summarization tech and task in the era of LLM.
